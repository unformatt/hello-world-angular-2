# hello-world-angular-2
This demonstrates how to write a very simple Angular 2 application without any noise! You don't need to have npm or webpack to run this application; Just a browser is enough! 
The application is being written in Typescript and ES6 classes. 

Open up the source file and read the components on top of it to get hold of how it's built!


###How to Run:
Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/antoaravinth/hello-world-angular-2.git
```

And then go inside the directory and run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and go to `localhost:3000`. Now you will be seeing your Angular 2 application live! As simple as that.
